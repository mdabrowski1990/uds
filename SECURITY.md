We have a special `Security Developer` rank for developers who are trusted and trained to deal with security issues.
Our intention is to highlight people with exceptional skills who can be relied upon.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you have noticed any security vulnerability, you can report it via:
- e-mail: [uds-package-development@googlegroups.com](mailto:uds-package-development@googlegroups.com)
- discord: https://discord.gg/y3waVmR5PZ

If you have found a safety critical issue that must be fixed quietly, then please contact directly at least 
two of our [Security Developers](#security-developers).
It would help us to keep things as quiet as possible until the problem is officially resolved.
