# How to Contribute
I am glad that you are reading this as I need help to make this project successful and widely used. You will find on this page all the necessary information to become valuable contributor in my [UDS project](https://github.com/mdabrowski1990/uds).


## Before You Start
I recommend you to [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/uds-package-development/about) first as we discuss hot topics there. It is also a place to simply say 'hi', tell a few words about yourself, what are you good at, what can you or would like to do in the project. We welcome anyone who wants to help while providing open and supportive environment and offering great learning experience.
If you are willing to help, but you have no python skills, you can still be an influential member of this project! Let us know what are your skill and we will find you a role matching your ambitions and abilities!
