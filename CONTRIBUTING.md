# How to Contribute
I am glad that you are reading this as I need help to make this project successful and widely used. You will find on this page all the necessary information to become contributor in my [project](https://github.com/mdabrowski1990/uds).


## Before you start
I recommend you to [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/uds-package-development/about) first as we discuss hot topics there. It is also a place to simply say 'hi', tell a few words about yourself, what are you good at, what can you or would like to do in the project. We welcome anyone who wants to help while providing open and supportive environment.


## Coding Convention
Following standards/guidelines are applied in the code:
- [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [pep257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- reStructuredText for all docstrings

Compliance with these standards/guidelines is checked during [static test analysis](TODO).


## Software Development Process Lifecycle
Due to limited resources that we have available for the project, I want to focus on using them efficiently. My plan is to maximize work undone and focus on providing high quality product with little technical debt, so we avoid wasting resources on maintenance.
