I am glad that you are reading this as I need help to make this project successful and widely used. 
You will find on this page all the necessary information to become valuable contributor in my [UDS project](https://github.com/mdabrowski1990/uds).


## Before You Start
I recommend you to [join mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/uds-package-development/about) first as hot topics are discussed there.
It is also a place to simply say 'hi', share your story, tell what you are good at and what would you like do.
We welcome anyone who wants to help while providing open and supportive environment and offering great learning experience.

**You are motivated to help bit you have no python skill?** No problem, you can still become an influential member of our team!
