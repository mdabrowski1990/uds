    Raw Data Records are the most basic Data Records which do not contain translation between physical and raw values.

    Common Use Cases:
     - Fillers without any meaning (e.g. reserved values)
     - Entries with unknown meaning
     - Big data containers (e.g. DID structures) with multiple children
