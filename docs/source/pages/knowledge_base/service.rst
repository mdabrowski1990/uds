Diagnostic Service
==================
Diagnostic services are functions offered by :ref:`Servers (ECUs) <knowledge-base-server>` to
a :ref:`Client <knowledge-base-client>` via the UDS protocol.
Each service is identified by a Service Identifier (SID) value.


.. _knowledge-base-sid:

Service Identifier
------------------
The Service Identifier (SID) is the first byte of the payload (Application Data, A_Data) in each
:ref:`diagnostic message <knowledge-base-diagnostic-message>`.

The SID value determines whether the message is a :ref:`request message <knowledge-base-request-message>`
or a :ref:`diagnostic response <knowledge-base-response-message>`.
It also defines the general purpose and format of the diagnostic message.

List of all Service Identifier (SID) values and their application:

Request Service Identifier
``````````````````````````
Request Service Identifier is a subtype of SID. It is the first byte of each request message and identifies
the diagnostic service for which the message is relevant.

.. note:: The 2nd most significant bit (bit 6) of all Request Service Identifiers is 0.


.. _knowledge-base-rsid:

Response Service Identifier
```````````````````````````
Response Service Identifier (RSID) is a subtype of SID. It is the first byte of each response message and identifies
the diagnostic service for which the message is relevant.

.. note:: The 2nd most significant bit (bit 6) of all Response Service Identifiers is 1.


DiagnosticSessionControl
------------------------
DiagnosticSessionControl service is used to change diagnostic sessions in the server(s).
In each diagnostic session a different set of diagnostic services (and/or functionalities) is enabled in the server.
Server shall always be in exactly one diagnostic session.


ECUReset
--------
ECUReset service is used by the client to request a server reset.


ClearDiagnosticInformation
--------------------------
ClearDiagnosticInformation service is used by the client to clear all diagnostic information (DTC and related data)
in one or multiple servers' memory.


ReadDTCInformation
------------------
ReadDTCInformation service allows the client to read from any server or group of servers within a vehicle,
current information about all Diagnostic Trouble Codes.
This could be a status of reported Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC), number of currently active DTCs or any other
information returned by supported ReadDTCInformation SubFunctions.


ReadDataByIdentifier
--------------------
ReadDataByIdentifier service allows the client to request data record values from the server identifier by one or more
DataIdentifiers (DIDs).


ReadMemoryByAddress
-------------------
ReadMemoryByAddress service allows the client to request server's memory data stored under provided memory address.


ReadScalingDataByIdentifier
---------------------------
ReadScalingDataByIdentifier service allows the client to request from the server a scaling data record identified
by a DataIdentifier (DID). The scaling data contains information such as data record type (e.g. ASCII, signed float),
formula and its coefficients used for value calculation, units, etc.


SecurityAccess
--------------
SecurityAccess service allows the client to unlock functions/services with restricted access.


CommunicationControl
--------------------
CommunicationControl service allows the client to switch on/off the transmission and/or the reception of certain
messages on a server(s).


Authentication
--------------
Authentication service provides a means for the client to prove its identity, allowing it to access data and/or
diagnostic services, which have restricted access for, for example security, emissions, or safety reasons.


.. _knowledge-base-service-read-data-by-periodic-identifier:

ReadDataByPeriodicIdentifier
----------------------------
ReadDataByPeriodicIdentifier service allows the client to request the periodic transmission of data record values
from the server identified by one or more periodicDataIdentifiers.


DynamicallyDefineDataIdentifier
-------------------------------
DynamicallyDefineDataIdentifier service allows the client to dynamically define in a server a DataIdentifier (DID)
that can be read via the ReadDataByIdentifier_ service at a later time.


WriteDataByIdentifier
---------------------
WriteDataByIdentifier service allows the client to write information into the server at an internal location
specified by the provided DataIdentifier (DID).


InputOutputControlByIdentifier
------------------------------
InputOutputControlByIdentifier service allows the client to substitute a value for an input signal, internal server
function and/or force control to a value for an output (actuator) of an electronic system.


RoutineControl
--------------
RoutineControl service allows the client to execute a defined sequence of steps to obtain any relevant result.
There is a lot of flexibility with this service, but typical usage may include functionality such as erasing memory,
resetting or learning adaptive data, running a self-test, overriding the normal server control strategy.


RequestDownload
---------------
RequestDownload service allows the client to initiate a data transfer from the client to the server (download).


RequestUpload
-------------
RequestUpload service allows the client to initiate a data transfer from the server to the client (upload).


TransferData
------------
TransferData service is used by the client to transfer data either from the client to the server (download) or
from the server to the client (upload).


RequestTransferExit
-------------------
RequestTransferExit service is used by the client to terminate a data transfer between the client and server.


RequestFileTransfer
-------------------
RequestFileTransfer service allows the client to initiate a file data transfer either from the server to
the client (download) or from the server to the client (upload).


WriteMemoryByAddress
--------------------
WriteMemoryByAddress service allows the client to write information into server's memory data under provided
memory address.


.. _knowledge-base-service-tester-present:

TesterPresent
-------------
TesterPresent service is used by the client to indicate to a server(s) that the client is still connected to a vehicle
and certain diagnostic services and/or communication that have been previously activated are to remain active.


SecuredDataTransmission
-----------------------
SecuredDataTransmission service is applicable if a client intends to use diagnostic services defined
in this document in a secured mode. It may also be used to transmit external data, which conform to
some other application protocol, in a secured mode between a client and a server. A secured mode in
this context means that the data transmitted is protected by cryptographic methods.


ControlDTCSetting
-----------------
ControlDTCSetting service allows the client to stop or resume the updating of DTC status bits in the server(s) memory.


.. _knowledge-base-service-response-on-event:

ResponseOnEvent
---------------
ResponseOnEvent service allows the client to request from the server to start or stop transmission of responses on
a specified event.


LinkControl
-----------
LinkControl service allows the client to control the communication between the client and the server(s) to
gain bus bandwidth for diagnostic purposes (e.g. programming).
