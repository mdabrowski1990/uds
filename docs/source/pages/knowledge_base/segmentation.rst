Segmentation
============
If diagnostic message <knowledge-base-diagnostic-message data to be transmitted does not fit into a single frame,
then segmentation process is required to divide :ref:`diagnostic message <knowledge-base-diagnostic-message>`
into smaller pieces called :ref:`UDS packets <knowledge-base-uds-packet>`.
