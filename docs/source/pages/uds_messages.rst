- :python:`UDSMessage` - common implementation of all diagnostic messages (both requests and responses)
- :python:`UDSRequest` - implementation of diagnostic request messages that are transmitted by servers and received by clients
- :python:`UDSResponse` - implementation of diagnostic response message that are transmitted by clients and received by servers
