Overview
--------
The purpose of this project is to provide python tools for simulation (on both sides - client and server) and
monitoring of diagnostic communication defined by ISO-14229. It can be used with any bus type (e.g. CAN, Ethernet, LIN).

The most likely use cases of this package are:
 - communication with your vehicle (e.g. reading Diagnostic Trouble Codes)
 - monitoring and decoding ongoing UDS communication
 - performing tests against on-board ECU (server)
 - performing tests against OBD Tester (client)
