Message handling
''''''''''''''''

- Send UDS message:

.. include:: ../../../../../examples/can/python-can/kvaser/send_message.py
    :code: python

- Receive UDS message:

.. include:: ../../../../../examples/can/python-can/kvaser/receive_message.py
    :code: python

- Send UDS message on one interface, receive on the other:

.. include:: ../../../../../examples/can/python-can/kvaser/send_and_receive_message.py
    :code: python


Packet handling
'''''''''''''''

- Send CAN packets:

.. include:: ../../../../../examples/can/python-can/kvaser/send_packet.py
    :code: python

- Receive CAN packets:

.. include:: ../../../../../examples/can/python-can/kvaser/receive_packet.py
